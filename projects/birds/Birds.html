                <h1> Humming Bird </h1>
                <hr>

                <p>
                * Hummingbirds are birds native to the Americas and constitute the biological family<span>Trochilidae.</span>
                There are about 360 species. They occur from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego but the vast majority of the species are found in the tropics.
                They are small birds, most species measuring 7.5–13 cm in length. The smallest extant hummingbird species is the 5 cm bee hummingbird, which weighs less than 2.0 g.
                The largest hummingbird species is the 23 cm giant hummingbird, weighing 18–24 g. They are specialized for feeding on nectar but all species also consume insects or spiders.
                Hummingbirds split from their sister group, the swifts and tree swifts, around 42 million years ago. The common ancestor of extant hummingbirds is estimated to have lived 22 million years ago.
                They are known as hummingbirds because of the <span>humming sound</span>created by their beating wings, which flap at high frequencies audible to humans.
                They hover in mid-air at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around 12 beats per second in the largest species to in excess of 80 in some of the smallest.
                Of those species that have been measured in wind tunnels, their<span> top speeds exceed</span> 15 m/s (54 km/h) and some species can dive at speeds in excess of 23 m/s (83 km/h).
                Most male hummingbirds attract a female with their rather<span> feeble song</span>. In a few species the males perform complex aerial displays.
                The small neat cup-shaped nest is decorated with moss or lichen and is usually attached with cobwebs to thin branches of a tree or bush but a few species attach their nest beneath a large leaf such as a palm frond.
                For all species the female alone builds the nest, incubates the clutch of two white eggs and feeds the nestlings.
                Hummingbirds have the highest mass-specific metabolic rate of any homeothermic animal. 
                To conserve energy when food is scarce and nightly when not foraging, they can go into torpor, a state similar to hibernation, and slow their metabolic rate to 1/15 of its normal rate.

                <h1> Mocking Bird </h1>
                <hr>

                <p>Mockingbirds are a group of New World passerine birds from the family <span>Mimidae</span>.
                   Those commonly found in North America is the <span>northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos)</span>. The Greek word means 'multiple languages'. Mockingbirds are known for singing late at night, even past midnight.
                   Best known for the habit of some species mimicking the songs of other birds and the sounds of insects and amphibians, in rapid succession.
                   There are about 17 species in two <span>genera</span>, although three species of mockingbird from the Galapagos Islands were formerly separated into a third genus, <span>Nesomimus</span>.
                   The mockingbirds do not form a monophyletic lineage, as <span>Mimus and Melanotis</span> are not each other's closest relatives. 
                   Melanotis appears to be more closely related to the catbirds, while the closest living relatives of Mimus appear to be thrashers, such as the <span>sage thrasher</span>.

                <h1> Crow </h1>
                <hr>

                <p>A crow is a bird of the genus <span>Corvus</span>, or more broadly a synonym for all of Corvus. The word "crow" is used as part of the common name of species
                   * Corvus is a widely distributed genus of medium-sized to large birds in the family <span>Corvidae</span></br>.
                   The genus includes species commonly known as crows, ravens and rooks; there is no consistent distinction between "crows" and "ravens", and these appellations have been assigned to different species chiefly on the basis of their size, crows generally being smaller than ravens. 
                   The 45 or so members of this genus occur on all temperate continents except South America, and several islands. The crow genus makes up a third of the species in the family Corvidae. The members appear to have evolved in Asia from the corvid stock, which had evolved in Australia.</br> 
                   The collective name for a group of crows is a "flock" or a "murder". The genus name is Latin for "raven".

                <h1> The Eagle </h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family <span>Accipitridae</span>. Eagles belong to several groups of genera. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and Africa. Outside this area, just 14 species can be found - 2 in North America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia.
                   Eagles are not a natural group, but denote essentially any bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrate prey.
                   Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the South Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g and 40 cm. 
                   Eagles normally build their nests, called <span>eyries</span>, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The dominant chick tends to be a female, as they are bigger than the male. The parents take no action to stop the killing.
